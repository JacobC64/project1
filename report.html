    <ul>
        <li>1: I created a website for my friend's basement that we, during the summer,
            transformed so that we could do Jiu Jitsu together. I created it as if
            it were a full MMA gym.
        </li>
        <li>
            2: I am not sure if I followed this rule because I embeded a google calendar
            and map into my website. I thought they were a cool addition to the page
            so I went with it so I hope it doesn't invalidate this rule.
        </li>
        <li>
            3: I have 5 seperate pages and I believe they all serve a unique purpose.
            One of them is index.html.
        </li>
        <li>
            4: I have a header, it is just the name of gym and the nav links though.
        </li>
        <li>
            5: I have nav links to each of my 5 pages.
        </li>
        <li>
            6: I used media query and applied styling so that it works on desktop and
            mobile. The nav links become a menu button and the page's layout becomes
            vertical rather than horizontal.
        </li>
        <li>
            7: I preserved the pages style accross each page with primary colors being
            light blue and grey and each page with the same layout.
        </li>
        <li>
            8: I include images of my friends equipment that we use to do BJJ and exercise
            and I have included alt tags. The only problem is that the content slider 
            guide that I used to help me used the attribute background-image: url()
            and didn't allow for a alt tag so I only have the alt tags present in the 
            gallery page.
        </li>
        <li>
            9: I drew a favicon, it is a house and BJJ under it, thus basement BJJ.
        </li>
        <li>
            10: I have my js and css files. I am kinda confused what is meant by this
            requirement. 
        </li>
        <li>
            11: I didn't use any libraries, bootstrap, Reach, etc, in my project.
        </li>
        <li>
            12: I checked each page with the Nu Validator and corrected the errors
            and warnings.
        </li>
        <li>
            13: I have left and top alignment among the middle section, my header and
            footer are center alignment though so the page doesn't have a very strong
            axis of alignment. 
        </li>
        <li>
            14: I used sans-serif for the headers and serif for the body text. 
        </li>
        <li>
            15: I have a sign up page that pops up a thank you message when send is
            clicked, but the content doesn't go anwywhere.
        </li>
        <li>
            16: I have links to "sponsers" websites. 
        </li>
        <li>
            17: I have them formatted and I have distnct id's. 
        </li>
        <li>
            18: I have a content slider that goes through the picutes on my site
            and it includes an animation.
        </li>
        <li>
            19: I have shared my git with you.
        </li>
        <li>
            20-23: I followed your set up page and each of these requirements were
             completed by following your guide.
        </li>
        <li>24:
            I don't have a consistent flow of commits, I procrastinated and left most
            of the work till the end. Sorry. I had fun doing the work though so I wish
            I had done it under less stress. I will fix this for project 2. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Critique: I decieded to use the holy grail method but it seems kind of dated
            and ugly. My content slider is janky because the pictures are all different 
            resolutions so I had to either cut them or make them distorted so I left it 
            janky. This problem follows in the gallery page as well because theres lots 
            of weird unsymmetrical white space between the pictures.
